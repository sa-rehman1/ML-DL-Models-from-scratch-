# ML & DL Models From Scratch

A comprehensive collection of **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models implemented from scratch** using only Python and NumPy.  
The purpose of this repository is to understand the **inner workings of algorithms** without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
